# PFE
in this program we tried to simulate the diffusion of rumors,the IC and Lt model are  both  implemented .
we defined  17 nodes,and we creat edges between them ,in purpose we had 2 nodeswhich make  an independent graphe to show that rumor can't propagate if there's no links between the infected node and other nodes .
we choose a circulair projection of the graphe so we can see easly the links and the propagation we could use an other projection 
the infected nodes are represented  by red color and the others are in green .
